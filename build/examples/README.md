### Data Ecosystem
Based on this infrastructure, since the data format and data standards are the same, data applications can coordinate processing objects such as identification, marking, classification, sorting, scoring, analysis, authentication, and status binding. Therefore, upper-layer applications can obtain accurate identification, business granularity, object abstraction layer, and grouping operation capabilities. POD core is committed to helping these data projects better adopt POD to provide data services.
