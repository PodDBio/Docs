# POD: The Web3 Infrastructure for Data Collaboration

## Introduction

POD is an on-chain data middleware built across various blockchain networks that aims to create a secure and trustworthy third-party data collaboration platform.

In this paper, we review the current situation of on-chain data usage and explain how POD can revolutionize data collaboration in the Metaverse.

## Current Landscape

### Background 

The year 2021 marks an era of metaverse. Facebook renamed itself “Meta”, Microsoft and Nvidia also announced their metaverse strategies.

The metaverse boom triggers the growth of activities in entertainment, social networking, e-commerce, content creation, etc., which brings the increase of blockchain users, on-chain assets and businesses. In the blockchain world, these are represented by on-chain entities. An on-chain entity refers to a specific existence on the blockchain that can be identified via its address or asset ID, such as an NFT or a contract. The data providing information about these entities are their metadata.

Data consumers in the metaverse can include not only humans but also programs, smart contracts, and physical machines (e.g., ticket vending machines). To ensure a smooth data collaboration experience, metadata should be structured and relational, so they are easy to be searched and used by both humans and software. 

Therefore, the time has come to design an innovative approach to store, organize, manage, and use on-chain metadata.

### Obstacles 

There are a few obstacles that interfere data collaboration on the level of metadata. 

#### Hard to Find

On-chain data are scattered in contracts on different networks. It is not yet possible for contracts to obtain all data from one single common data environment. To access certain data element, a system must establish peer-to-peer communication directly with the contract that stores it.

#### Hard to Relate

Due to the non-relational storage, it is hard to trace the relationship between two entities or associate entities with their metadata. As a result, it is a challenge to classify and make sense out of on-chain metadata.

#### Hard to Utilize

Each network or app is unique in the way it transmits data, which means its APIs, data encoding methods, and access control may not be compatible with those of others. Thus, the process of data management and usage is not yet automated. Data from diverse sources must be pre-processed before they can work in tandem.

## POD’s Solution

As a neutral third-party data middleware, POD will tackle these obstacles by providing the key functionalities listed below and realize the full potential of metadata. 

### I. Entity-based Metadata Storage

In POD, all metadata must be associated with an on-chain entity. POD brings new methods of data binding and distribution. As a carrier of metadata, tags are used to realize a non-transferable binding relationship between data and entities. That is, user only needs to verify whether the entity has a tag, and then can read the required data from the tag, which will facilitate the verification and acquisition of the entity data.

In addition, in POD, metadata can be in the form of values or logic. Values are definite, like tags, certifications, descriptions, etc. Logic refers to programming logic that can get a value or store a value based on a given condition. For example, an algorithm that calculates real-time reputation scores based on the user's status; or an NFT with lottery scripts for NFT components. 

Due to this design, any on-chain entity can acquire two new abilities.
1. Entity-based, infinite expandability

   Entity will no longer be limited to the issuer’s initial business and will add logic by binding new data to the third-party storage space of the POD. POD allows anyone, any organization, to bind any number of tags to any entity on the chain at any time, which means that POD can add metadata of any dimension to the entity, thus bringing infinite evolution possibilities of the entity. This is particularly useful for games in scenarios where characters usually have default initial attributes and players can upgrade their abilities and weapons later. These new functions can even be generated by user UGC. POD can support endless games. In theory, characters can evolve infinitely.

2. Entity-based, collaboration ability

   Taking the entity as the center, reading, writing, and maintaining data together, forming the possibility of multi-party collaboration around the entity and its specific attributes. Such as item wear rating, quality information, insurance, brand logo, combination information, loan, etc.

Through POD, we can make each NFT, or each on-chain entity obtain expandability and collaboration ability, which will expand the application scenarios, let NFT and on-chain entities have unlimited value possibilities.

### II. Metadata Type Definition

The metadata type includes the set of rules for how to store certain type of metadata elements and the description of this kind of metadata. It plays a key role in bringing together data from various sources and structuring them to support desired business logics. It can also be considered as an index of data, so that users can easily find data, verify data, use data and manage data.

The metadata type makes it possible to define on-chain entities and store metadata from below three aspects. 

1. Species

   Users can define and classify a class of entities or concepts by giving them a species name and marking them on the chain. That is, through POD, user can easily realize the definition and classification of on-chain entities or concepts on the chain. The species can be verified , reused by anyone, and can be edited and managed according to user-defined conditions.

   For example, to addresses, Nike fan tags can be defined and bound to user addresses; Level tags can be defined and bound to DAO users. To NFTs, shoes kind, car kind, monster kind can be bounded.

2. Attribute

   Like mentioned in the above topic, a metadata type specifies what attributes must be included to describe a certain type of entity. For example, you can define that the metadata of spaceship NFTs must include values representing the “Flight speed” attribute. It is also possible to set an attribute to be immutable by configuring the modification permission.

3. Relationship

   It is possible to demonstrate relationships between entities through metadata types. For example, you can specify your current use avatar from your avatar NFTs through the metadata type “My Current Use Avatar” which accordingly links your address with the NFT addresses. Any dApp can display avatars for users based on this relationship. By analogous way, we can define such as "Current logo" to bind brand logo NFT, "Current identity provider" to bind identity trust source, "Current status" to Indicates the status, "Current clothes" to bind clothes, etc.
   In other words, we can achieve combination of any on-chain entities based on relationships through user defined relationships base on POD.

### III. Data Conformity Across Platforms

The POD database consists of a series of contracts deployed on different blockchain networks. Such design ensures a consistent data definition and a unified data structure at the low level, so data within each network can reach conformity. At the same time, these contracts are linked together by the POD-Bridge, so one metadata type can be applied to data from different chains. In this way, data conformity will be realized across all networks, which is the prerequisite for users to work with UGC (User Generated Content) level metadata using the toolchain provided by POD.

Therefore, through POD, can allow all users easily to view and collaborate on the same data category with the same understanding of the same entity or concept. In other words, POD provides an abstraction layer for the crypto community, allowing anyone to define abstraction and collaboration on the abstraction layer.

## Look to the Future

POD brings together data from different contracts and blockchains, data defined and stored in POD are immediately actionable for contracts and users across all networks. As we gradually establish cooperation with more blockchain networks, POD will evolve into an open and trustworthy data infrastructure which empowers data communication in Web3. 

Looking ahead, we hope to bring different parties together and establish a collaborative dialogue, to inspire the decentralized community to arrive at an agreed data collaboration standard in a bottom-up manner. The standard potentially includes but is not limited to major entity classes, frequently used metadata types, data storage solutions for different purposes, transmission interface design, and so on. One the one hand, users can leverage this standard to seamlessly work with data from any network. On the other hand, they still have the freedom to tailor the standard practice according to their own businesses and needs. 

Thereby, POD will propel the data collaboration ecosystem to develop, which will enable focused business models, precise user segmentation and standardized data format at an elevated level. We envision more business opportunities and more flexible collaboration in the metaverse will be unlocked.
